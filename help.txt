  Welcome to Battleship - terminal game against bot!

  PREPARATION FOR BATTLE

  Both you and your opponent have 10x10 grid and fleet of 10 ships:
    1 x battleship - 4 cells
    2 x cruisers   - 3 cells each
    3 x destroyers - 2 cells each
    4 x submarines - 1 cell each

  First, you need to place your ships.

  Use arrows to move cursor around the grid,
  <Enter> to place current ship,
  <Space> to rotate it.

  Rules for placing ships:
  - Each ship occupies a number of adjacent cells on the grid, horizontally
    or vertically.
  - Ships can't touch each other with sides and corners.

  HOW TO PLAY

  The application randomly choose whose move is the first and then the battle
  begin.
  You and your opponent alternate turns, choosing a cell on the opponent's
  field and hitting it. If a player hits the ship, the next move does not pass
  to the opponent.

  Your goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before your fleet is
  destroyed.

  Use arrows to move around bot field and <Enter> to hit.
  The application will notify you if you missed, damaged or destroyed the ship
  of opponent.
